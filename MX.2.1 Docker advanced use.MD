# Docker - advanced use
In this file we will analyze a little more advanced aspects of Docker, such as the different types of volumes, the networking between containers and the replicas if the service is replicated.

## Docker memory limitation
A container has no resource constraints by default configuration; but Docker provides ways to control how much memory or CPU a container can use - to ensure that no single container can monopolize system resources, lead to performance issues or service disruptions for other containers or host services.

This is extremely important because if the kernel detects insufficient memory for critical system functions, it throws an **Out Of Memory** Exception (OOM), and can potentially kill processes (including Docker) - Docker daemon can manage this problem.
These options are essential for maintaining the stability and performance of **both containers and the host system**.

We can specify the memory limitations in the `docker run` command or put **directly** the option **in the Docker Compose**.
In the first case we add the `--memory` flag as we can see here:
```
docker run --name container_name --memory=512m image_name
```
But we can also manage the limitation here (example seen in class):
```yml
services:
  producer:
    build: producer-end
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
    depends_on:
      lavinmq:
        condition: service_healthy
```

In this case we use `mem_limit`, to set a basic memory limit for a container - **maximum amount of memory** that the container can use; but we can also use `mem_reservation`: it specify a **soft memory limit**, indicating the minimum amount of memory that should be reserved for the container. We can also combine both flags, for example (change a file seen in class):
```yml
services:
  product:
    build: microservices/product-service
    mem_limit: 512m
    mem_reservation: 256m
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
    depends_on:
      mongodb:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Docker volumes
Docker volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. There are different types of volumes: named, anonymous and bind. In this paragraph we want to analyze the characteristics of each type providing some examples.

_Is also important to say that if a service doesn't specify a volumes section, it means that the service won't have any volumes mounted. Essentially, **no data will be persisted outside the container** for that service._


### Named Volumes
Named Volumes are created and managed by Docker, allowing you to persist data across container restarts and removals.
Defined in the Docker-compose file or created by using command line with: `docker volume create`.\
Named volumes are not tied to a specific container instance and can be reused! **Perfects for scenarios where data persistence is required**.
```yml
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: projects
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
```
As we can see in the example, the volume is set with [...] **:** [...].\
The first part is the name of the volume (in out case `mongo-data`), the second one is the path in the container.

### Anonymous Volumes
Anonymous volumes are temporary volumes created by Docker when a container starts. They are typically used for temporary data, and they don't have a specific name, just because they are temporary.\
These volumes are ephemeral and are removed when the container is removed.
```yml
services:
  web:
    build: ./web
    volumes:
      - /app/temp
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
  [...]
```
As we can see, we don't have the name, but only the path. It means that Docker Compose will create an anonymous volume without a specific name.


### Bind Mounts
Bind mounts allow you to mount a directory or file from the host machine into the container. Bind Mounts allow you to map a host file or directory to a container file or directory. This is particularly useful during development when you want changes made on the host to be immediately reflected in the container.\
In a nutshell: _we want to use the bind mounts when we need direct access to the hostâ€™s filesystem for development, testing, or sharing configuration files._
```yml
services:
  config:
  build: config-server-end
  mem_limit: 512m
  environment:
    - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker,native
    [...]
  volumes:
    - ./config-repo:/config-repo
```
This means that a directory from the host machine (`./config-repo`) is mounted into the container at `/config-repo`.
